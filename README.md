# quic-tls-work

Experiments and WIP based on projects:

- [tls](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls) at commit `3727b12b`

- [quic](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/quic) at commit `a32ac198`

## Changes done

- Handshake mode and negotiated protocol are now taken from the TLS context and
  removed from `ApplicationSecretInfo`.

- Parameter `sharedExtensions` is renamed `sharedHelloExtensions` and added to
  `ServerHello` message before TLS 1.3.

## To do

- We could add a new `TLSError` constructor taking `SomeException` to hold a
  `QUICError` (or any other type the record layer wishes).  This would restore
  the possibility for QUIC to throw negotation failures from `quicRecv`.
